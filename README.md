# HotSwap
Game Jam November 2019 project, currently under continuing development as of November 2020 to polish and refine for a public release

--Git Workflow--

Moving forward this project will loosely follow a Gitflow workflow, with releases committed to master, work in between releases done in dev, with feature branches for each feature
Merges from feature branches to dev and from dev to master will be done using pull requests, without code reviews for feature->dev, but with code reviews for dev->master
Art content will be integrated by the artists branching off of master, adding their content to the labeled 'fresh asset' directory, and merging their branch back into master
